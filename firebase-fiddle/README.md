# Me vs Databases

I've always had a conflictual relationship with Databases: I always wanted to use them anywhere but, whenever I did, I could not avoid screaming at my computer out of rage!

They were stupid, error prone and kinda complicated.

Luckily firebase arrived to save the day: It's an easy to use Database as a Service, which does not necessarely require the separation of frontend and backend.

That is why it's so cool to use it with lightweight front-end libraires for Dom rendering: it just feels really light!

I also really enjoyed making the "material" design for the input and the button, so I might make a little library for material CSS, who knows!
