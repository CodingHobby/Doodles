# Me vs Frontend

So, if you're like me, you probably spend a lot of time testing new frameworks for frontend, backend, testing etc.

Well, that is how I discovered `choo`. But I wasn't really satisfied: I mean, it was lighter than React and Angular, but still, it felt kinda awkward. That is when I discovered the engine choo was based on: `yo-yo`.

Yo-yo is a library so light that it doesn't even feel like a library. It basically only has two functions: one to convert template strings into HTML elements, and one to update those elements. That's it.

It feels soooo cool to be able to do rendering to the DOM without a heavy library (or the hassle of just using JavaScript / JQuery)! It just makes you feel good!
