# FBott

Fbott is a project that just came out of nowhere: it was about seeing how much time it would've taken me to set up a FaceBook messenger bot (Don't worry, I'm still revising it to use some kind of wether API), and the amount of time was surprisingly low: I was able to do it in just about under an hour (it's true that, in that hour, I copy-pasted code from Facebook's Docs, but still!)

As you'll notice if you read the file, I'm pulling in all my acces tokens from an external file, which I am not including, for obvious reasons. Still, if you get stuck on this kind of problem, feel free to copy-paste the HELL out of this repo!
