# Serve me up, Scotty!

Since I've seen so great modules for hosting one's workspace, I thought I'd give it a shot, and this is what I came up with: it uses `morgan` to log out all the requests, it has directory listing, but it also displays index's and various things.

To use this module you have to install it globally, and then run the command `serve-me-up`. At this point, if you follow the provided link you will be transported to your hosted workspace in the browser!
