# Doodles


This is a repo to keep track of all of the wobbly doodles and strangely intriguing fiddles and side projects that I start without ever finishing, half baked pieces of code and tests for JavaScript libraries and frameworks, but also strange ideas which I get overnight and want to try! I keep all of these online because I think it will be fun, in a few years, looking back at all of this "fun code" and laugh at my bad programming skills.

If you want to submit your own fiddles, don't hesitate to for the repo! Have fun!
