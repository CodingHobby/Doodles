# UNI Syntax Theme

This theme was born out of both boredom and the need for a colorful theme, in which I could actually distinguish different syntax elements.

It's based on the `Material Theme` package, and it's supposed to be pretty-looking, but also use vast range of colors, whith high contrast between them.

This is my first theme/VSCode extension, so I'd love some feedback on it! If you have any suggestions inbox me @ `caneparicorrado@outlook.it`

I'm also planning on making a light version of this theme, although I don't know when I'll do it. Plus, since I usually use dark themes, I can't really tell what a **Good** light theme actually looks like!

I hope you find this theme enjoyable and somewhat good looking. Good luck with your coding!
