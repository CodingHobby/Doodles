# Pomodoro Timer

This project was kinda the "I don't want to do anything serious, now, so I'm just going to test out a few libraries" kinda thing.

I used Electron and Electron Packager to make it a cross platform app, which you can build with the command `npm make`

I created a couple of utility functions to format numbers and time stamps, and I used [mare-dom](https://npmjs.org/mare-dom) to render stuff to the DOM.

I also used Webpack to transpile includes from my files.

I wasn't sure what to make, so I just thought of the most simple, but still kinda useful thing: a [Pomodoro](https://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique) timer.
